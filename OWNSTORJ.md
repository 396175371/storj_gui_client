# OwnStorj

I'm started working on new feature in **Storj GUI** client called **OwnStorj**. 
This is web interface for Storj which have more features than standard GUI client. 
It is like OwnCloud, but storing files on Storj Distributed Storage Platform.
It will allow to share files with other users.
You will can run OwnStorj on your home NAS server, RaspberryPi or other hardware on any platform. 
Web interface is fully responsive. OwnStorj will also use **Storj.js** library.
It will also use WebSockets to provide interactive progress reporting during upload and download.
OwnStorj in future will also have application for mobile devices.

**Summary of planned OwnStorj features**:
- uploading and downloading files by web interface
- listing buckets, files
- buckat managing
- client and sync settings
- easy file sharing
- sorting and taging files
- billing and account managing
- many users on one OwnStorj instance
- node details
- node monitoring
- display geodistribution of shards and mirrors

**If you have any ideas of new features or other improvements related to OwnStorj, please create issue referenced to OwnStorj.**
